<p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are an essential part of modernizing healthcare systems. However, the needs of different stakeholders using EHRs can vary greatly. On one side, the Philippine government utilizes EHRs to improve public health surveillance, policy-making, and system-wide interoperability. On the other hand, physicians use EHRs primarily to enhance clinical efficiency, patient care, and daily workflows. This article compares the needs of the government with those of average physicians concerning EHR use.</p>
<h1>1. Government Needs in EHR Use</h1>
<p>The government’s interest in EHRs lies in its ability to leverage health data for broad, systemic improvements. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Public Health Surveillance</strong>: The government uses EHRs to monitor disease outbreaks, vaccination rates, and population health trends. Data from EHRs are essential for real-time tracking and early detection of epidemics. The <em>World Health Organization</em> highlights the importance of health information systems in public health surveillance and their role in rapid outbreak response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy Development</strong>: Aggregated EHR data helps governments develop policies by identifying healthcare gaps and evaluating resource distribution. Studies show that data analytics from EHRs can inform health policies by revealing patterns in healthcare delivery, disease prevalence, and patient outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability and Standardization</strong>: Governments need EHR systems that are standardized and interoperable across different healthcare facilities. This ensures that health information flows smoothly between hospitals, clinics, and national health databases. The <em>Philippine eHealth Strategic Framework and Plan (2014–2020)</em> sets guidelines for establishing interoperability among EHR systems nationwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulation and Compliance</strong>: EHRs are crucial for the government to monitor healthcare providers' compliance with the <em>Data Privacy Act of 2012</em>. This law regulates the handling of personal health information to ensure patient privacy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>2. Physicians' Needs in EHR Use</h1>
<p>For physicians, EHR systems are vital for improving clinical outcomes and streamlining workflows. Their needs differ significantly from the government's focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Patient-Centered Care</strong>: EHRs provide physicians with instant access to patients' medical histories, lab results, and treatment plans. This ensures more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. Studies show that access to comprehensive EHR data leads to improved quality of care and patient outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency in Clinical Workflows</strong>: Physicians rely on EHRs to reduce time spent on administrative tasks such as documentation and data entry. The focus is on efficiency, with many physicians valuing EHR systems that streamline their workflows and reduce the burden of data management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability for Continuity of Care</strong>: While the government is concerned with system-wide interoperability, physicians need it for continuity of care. Interoperability allows for seamless sharing of patient information between healthcare providers, ensuring that care is consistent across different settings and specialties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization and Usability</strong>: Physicians prefer EHR systems that offer customization options, allowing them to tailor the system to their specialty and practice style. Usability studies indicate that customizable EHR systems lead to higher adoption rates among clinicians.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>While the Philippine government and physicians both use EHRs, their needs are distinct. The government is focused on system-wide improvements such as public health surveillance, interoperability, and policy-making, while physicians prioritize patient care, workflow efficiency, and usability. To create a balanced healthcare system, EHR systems must address both macro-level (government) and micro-level (physician) needs to ensure they benefit public health as well as individual patient care.</p>
